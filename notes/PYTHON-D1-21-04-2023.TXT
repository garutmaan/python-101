Computers -> Machine which performs task which humans cant' do quickly

- Commands/Instructions Given to computer by humans to perform tasks

- to instruct or communicate with anybody we need Langauge

- to communicate and get work done by computer we need a laguage

- That type of language is called programming

- We write commands/program which will be translated to a computer 
- then computer will perform requested task

- the process of translating human instructions in human-friendly language (english) to computer-friendly language(binary), is called Compilation/Interpretation.

- Types of Programming Languages
1. Compiled languages
	- First read all the given instrcutions (programs)
	- then validate the syntax/format of the entire program
	- If everything is good, then start execution

- It needs a compiler (translator from english to binary)
 - Validates the given program
 - highlights syntax errors
 - Creates an executable file if the program is validated correctly

Known errors : 

1. Syntax error : any mistake in the format of writing a program
2. Logical Error  : any mistake in the way the program flow is written -> BUG
3. Run time error : any error which occurs only during the execution of the program. -> CRASH

- C - C Compiler 
- C++ 
- java - JRE, JDK

2. Interpreted Languages
	- pickup first line of the program, execute it
	- pickup next line, execute it
	- if the current is broken or contains any error, stop the execution

- Require interpreter
 - read the first of the program
 - start executing
 - during execution it will check syntax, logical error, run time errors
 - the program stops of any line is not correct

 Ex:

 - Python
 - perl
 - html
 - shell script
 - Ruby

1. Python Programming

Any language  Vs Python
==========================
 - Structure - Format
 - How to Speak - how to Execute
 - Alphabets - tokens
 - Words - Identifiers, Variables
 - Sentences - Statements, instructions
 - Grammar - Syntax
 - Paragraphs - Blocks, Functions etc
 - Vocabulary - Libraries

Structure Of Python : 

1. The program must be written in a text file with name ending with .py extension.

ex: hello_world.py

2.  inside this python file, the format of python code is arranged in below way :

1. import statements (optional, if required use)
2. statements
3. global variables
4. statements
5. function definitions
6. statements

ex:

hello_world.py
print('Hello World')

We have diff ways to Edit python code:

1. Text editor - only edit the code
2. IDLE (python's own interpreter+text editor) - edit + run
3. IDE - edit + run + debug + build entire project
(integrate development environment)

How to execute?

1. using command line 

> python hello_world.py

2. using IDLE 

you can run the python file u edited inside IDLE itself

3. using IDE 

- you can run the python file inside the IDE using GUI options

4. Some text editors have plugins to run python code
like sublime : using ctrl+B

5. REPL.it : online editor + python interpreter

When to use ? : when u want to quickly try out some python code without need to setup or configure python in ur local.
you can execute on your phone browser as well
