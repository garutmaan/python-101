To make decisions based on some conditions, python will decide what flow to execute or what block or instructions to execute.

Flow-Control/Conditional/Branching/Decision Making Instructions/Statments
	- if statements
	- nested statements
	- if-else statements
	- if-elif statements
	- if-elif-else statements

if- statement:

if is a keyword used to evaluate any condition or data and execute the code if the condition is True else skip it.

Syntax:

if <condition>:
	stmt1
	stm2
	stm3
	..
	..
	..

other-statment

ex:

a = 10
if a>5:
	print(a)
	print("This is if block.")

print("This is regular statement after if")

b=20
if a and b:
	print("a = ", a)
	print("b = ", b)

Nested - if - statement:

if we want to check or include multiple levels of decision making withing decision making statments, we can use nested statements.

Syntax:

if <condtion1>:
	stm1
	stm2
	if <condtion2>:
		stm3
		stm4
		..
		..
	stm5
	stm6
	if <condtion3>:
		stm7
		stm8
		..
		if <condtion4>:
			stm9
			stm10

ex:

# grading system

marks=99

if marks > 33:
	print("Pass")
	if marks > 60:
		print("With First Class")
		if marks > 90:
			print("And Distinction")
			if marks > 95:
				print("Congratulations!")




if-else statement:

if we have any alternative operations, incase our decision making doesnt qualify, we use "else" statment to execute those alternative statements.

syntax:

if <condtion>:
	stm1
	stm2
else:
	stm3
	stm4

Note:
1. else should always have its associated if statement
2. without if else cant be written
3. else block also can contain if-else statements

Nested if-else:

if condtion:
	stm1
	if condtion:
		stm4
	else:
		stm5
else:
	stm2
	if condtion:
		stm6
		stm7
		if condtion:
			stm10
		else:
			stm11
	else:
		stm8
		stm9

ex:

# print grades based marks

marks = 90

if (marks >= 90 and marks <= 100):
	print("A Grade")

if (marks >= 60 and marks <= 90):
	print("B Grade")

if (marks >= 45 and marks <= 60):
	print("C Grade")

if (marks >= 30 and marks <= 45):
	print("D Grade")
else:
	print("This Person has FAILED with F grade.")


else-if-statements:
when we want to execute any other condition before finally concluding the decision making, we use "else-if" type of statements.

else-if is written as "elif" in python.

syntax:

if condtion:
	stm1
elif condtion:
	stm2
else:
	stm3

elif-ladder-concept:

if condtion:
	stm1
elif condtion:
	stm2
elif condtion:
	stm3
elif condtion:
	stm4
else:
	stm5

Note: elif must have an if statement.
elif ladder also can be nested.

ex:

marks = 95

if (marks >= 90 and marks <= 100):
	print("A Grade")
elif (marks >= 60 and marks <= 90):
	print("B Grade")
elif (marks >= 45 and marks <= 60):
	print("C Grade")
elif (marks >= 30 and marks <= 45):
	print("D Grade")
else:
	print("This Person has FAILED with F grade.")
