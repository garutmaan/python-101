OPERATORS:

2. RELATIONAL OPERATORS

we use these for comparisons.

1. Greater Than >
2. Less Than <
3. Greater Than or Equal >=
4. Less than or equal <=

	Equality Operators:

	5. Equals to ==
	6. Not Equal !=

Note: The result of relational operation is a boolean value (either true or false)
Note: That's why we mostly use these inside conditional-statements

Examples:

num1 = 10
num2 = 100

# Relational Operator
result=num2>num1 # returns True because num2 is > num1
print(result)
result=num1>num2 # false
print(result)
result=num1>=num2 # false
print(result)
result=num2<num1 # false
print(result)
result=num1<num2 # true 
print(result)
result=num1<=num2 # true
print(result)
result=num2==num1 # false
print(result)
result=num1!=num2 # true
print(result)


Note: comparisons are always made with memory location

we can use id() function to find out the memory location of variable.

note : if , the values of different variables are same, they are always stored in single location. that's why the comparison results in case of equals , returns true, if location is same : here, memory location is checked.


num1=100
num2=10

print("num1 is stored at : " , id(num1))
print("num2 is stored at : " , id(num2))

result = (num1 == num2)
print(result)

result = (num1 != num2)
print(result)

num1 = 100
num2 = num2 * num2

print("num1 is stored at : " , id(num1))
print("num2 is stored at : " , id(num2))

result = (num1 == num2)
print(result)

result = (num1 != num2)
print(result)

Output:

/usr/bin/python3.8 /home/costrategix/Training/Python/d4_operators.py 
num1 is stored at :  9796224
num2 is stored at :  9793344
False
True
num1 is stored at :  9796224
num2 is stored at :  9796224
True
False

Process finished with exit code 0

Note: in case of chekcing null values, NoneType is checked against the memory location, which should not be done.

example:

data_list = [10, 20]
result = data_list == None # not a good idea, we should use is or is not operations here
print(result)

IDE TIP : # Comment a selected Block short cut key : 
1. Select the block of code
2. Press Ctrl + / TO COMMENT
3. Press Ctrl + / again to UNCOMMENT

Note: Operator Chaining:

we can compare multiple values in chain: the comparison happens from left to right
Chaining works only with == , operators

example:

result = num1<num2<num3>num4 # doesnt work, we will get the result of first operation only

num1=10
num2=10
num3=1
num4=10

result = num1==num2==num3==num4
print(result)


3. Logical Operators:

and => returns True only if all conditions return true
or => returns true if even one condition returns true
not => complement, reverses the result of condition or value

ex:

# Logical Operators:

'''
True and True => True
True and False => False

True or False => True
False or False => False

not True => False
not False => True
'''

num1 = 10
num2 = 100
num3 = 1000

result = (num1 > num2) and (num2 < num3)  # False
print(result)
result =(num1 > num2) or (num2 < num3)  # True
print(result)
result =(num1 > num2) and (not (num2 < num3))  # False
print(result)
